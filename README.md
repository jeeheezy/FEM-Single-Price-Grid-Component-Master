## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I was reminded that for mobile-first workflow, it's not enough to just keep in mind the mobile and write a media query, but to start with mobile as the default. 

I also got to try CSS grid for the first time instead of relying on only Flexbox. For setting columns for the grid, I avoided using pixels, instead opting ofr fr, and also rem for any max-width/font-size. 

Additionally, I learned there were performance concerns in using css @imports over linking fonts in html head. Another helpful tip was setting a border radius on the container with overflow: hidden instead of defining the radius for the individual children. 


### Continued development
I'd like to get further use of CSS grid, especially since many websites seem to recommend using grid for setting the layout and using Flexbox for adjusting the content within the layout.
